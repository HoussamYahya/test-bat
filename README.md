# pythontestbench

This repository contains the files for the python testbench

## Prerequisites

A python 3.x 32bits version is installed and included in the PATH

## Getting started

Run the command
```bash
install_virtual_environment.bat
```
It will create the python virtual environment and install the needed scripts

## Usage
The included librairies are:
* [pytest] (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries
* [python-can] (https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - provides Controller Area Network support for Python, providing common abstractions to different hardware devices, and a suite of utilities for sending and receiving messages on a CAN bus
